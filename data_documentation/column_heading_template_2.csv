This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D150_4, D150_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. Pooled figures include two cohorts of students."

Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For public institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term.
