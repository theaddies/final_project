For public institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LProgram), this represents the net price for the full program. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). Income categories are calculated from the income values used by the institution to calculate financial aid eligibility. For a dependent student, this includes the student's and the parents' income. For an independent student, this includes the student's adjusted gross income and, if the student is married, the spouse's income. This metric is not available prior to the 2009-10 academic year."
